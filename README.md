# The-Hindu-Crawler

The crawler will crawl the "The Hindu" newspaper website and search for the present day news for a set of categories. The crawled information will be then stored in the database. 

To run this project you will have to first download flask in your system. You can do it by:
`$ pip install flask` or
`$ conda install flask`

Then after setting up flask, you just have to got the directory where you have stored the files and type command 
`$ python HinduCrawler.py` 
to run the crawler and
`$ python project.py`
to run the website.
The website is hosted on local host so if you type ### 0.0.0.0:8000
you will see the contents.
